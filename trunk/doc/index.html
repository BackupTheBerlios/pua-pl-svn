		<h2>pua.pl</h2>
		
pua.pl is a command-line presence user agent in terms of RFC 3856. 
It uses SIP/SIMPLE to
communicate to a server, and supports partly the following standards:
rfc-3261 (SIP), rfc-3903 (PUBLISH), rfc-3265 & rfc-3856 (NOTIFY, SUBSCRIBE), 
rfc-3863 (pidf). <p>

It can do 3 things: 
register at a sip server, publish presence information and subscribe and 
watch to some other user's presence information. If you are not sure what 
this means, read on with section intro.<p>

<h3><a name="intro">Intro</a></h3>

Here, presence means the willingness and ability of a user to communicate with
other users on the network. The presence information gives the way how to 
to communicate. Consider the following example: you would like to be contacted 
via email, only in urgent cases on your mobile phone. The presence information 
might include the following: <p>
<ul>
  <li>your id (sip-id)</li>
  <li>a so-called tuple foreach means of communication, i.e. one for the 
    email and one for the mobile phone</li>
  <li>the priority of the email higher than the priority of the phone, as 
    the email is the prefered way</li>
  <li>a kind of textual note, like 'If it is urgent, just call me on the mobile'</li>
</ul><p>
If this information is published, everybody knowing the sip-id (and having 
permission) can check it, before contacting you, so the idea is to have no 
more calls like "sorry if i disturb you but ...". Publishing means, the 
presence information is transmitted to a public server. On the other hand, 
if one of your friends wants to call you, and first wants to check your 
presence information, she subscribes to it, i.e. she tells the presence 
server that she would like to receive it, and also receive further 
notifications the moment it changes. <p>

Presence information can be provided for almost any way of communication: 
email, telephony, instant messaging, Push-to-talk, ... <p>

The whole system works only if it is possible to publish presence information 
from not just one PC, but from any communication device, like PDAs, laptops. 
Another example: you plan to go on holiday, and you set your presence 
information for to 'closed' (means offline). During your holiday, you find a 
nice internet cafe, and you go there for a chat with your friends. So you 
would like to subscribe for their presence status. This time server has to 
send the notifications to the pc in the internet cafe. The process of telling 
the server which device is connected to your sip-id is called registration, 
i.e. the software running on the PC in the internet cafe registers at the 
presence server. <p>


<h3><a name="use">How to use pua.pl</a></h3>

The 3 operations register, subscribe
and publish can be used in any combination. For each of the operations, there
are two modes possible 
<ol>
<li> Run and refresh untill program is ended: For instance if pua.pl
     should publish presence information, it will repeatedly send it to 
     the server in order to refresh it, until pua.pl is ended. On ending,
     the presence information will be removed from the server. This is the
     default behaviour.<p></li>

<li> Run once: pua.pl will register (resp. publish/notify) only once, and then
     it terminates. See the --xxx-once switches<p></li>
</ol>

pua.pl is only a presence client, it can send SUBSCRIBE requests and can 
process NOTIFY requests, but does not to support direct subscriptions from 
other endpoints - instead a presence server is expected to handle this. <p>

pua.pl is configured with command line options, not with config files. This
makes it a bit inconvenient to use for human beings - the intention was to make
its usable from other scripts or programs, it is for instance suitable for testing a presence agent. These are the common command line 
options required nearly for all operations:<p>
<div class="item">
  <code>--my-sip-id=uri</code> (short form: <code>-i=uri</code>) to set your
    SIP identity, usualy a URI of the form '<code>sip:myname@domain.org</code>'. <p>

  <code>--proxy=server (-x=server)</code> for the server name of the SIP proxy server,
    e.g. <code>-x=iptel.org</code><p>

  <code>--username=name (-u=name)</code> Username for authentification at the remote
    server<p>

  <code>--password=name (-pw=name)</code> Password for authentification at the remote
    server, in combination with -u.
</div>

<h3><a name="r">Register</a></h3>

In order to use pua.pl to register at a SIP server, additionally some 
parameters need to be specified on the command line:<p>
<div class="item">
  <code>--register</code> (short form: <code>-r</code>) to enable register operation at all.<p>

  <code>--registrar=uri (-rs=uri)</code> to specify the name of the registrar server,
    an uri like 'sip:someprovider.net:5060'. If no registrar is specified, 
    the register request will be sent to a server name constructed 
    from your address (as specified with <code>--my-id</code>). E.g. for a 
    given address <code>--my-sip-id=sip:myname@domain.org</code>, the registrar 
    will be guessed as 'sip:domain.org'.<p>
</div>

Some examples: register for the sip-id ron@iptel.org using the proxy server
sipserv.com, the registrar is iptel.org (taken the domain from iptel.org)<p>
<div class="item"><code>
  pua.pl -r -i=ron@iptel.org -x=sipserv.com<p>
</code></div>

Often the SIP proxy server and the registrar are on the same machine. The
registrar is explicitly specified with -rs:<p>
<div class="item"><code>
  pua.pl -r -i=ron@iptel.org -x=iptel.org -rs=iptel.org<p>
</code></div>

Iptel will not accept register requests without authentification, that can be
seen from the 401 error code. Do username/password should be specified as well:<p>
<div class="item"><code>
  pua.pl -r -i=ron@iptel.org -x=iptel.org -u ron -pw 'how cute'<p>
</code></div>


<h3><a name="s">Subscribe</a></h3>

To subscribe (or to watch) the presence information of some other user,
the command line options are needed:<p>
<div class="item">
  <code>--subscribe (-s)</code> to enable subscribe operation<p>

  <code>--watch-id=uri (-w=uri)</code>It sets the uri of the person whose presence
    status is to be subscribed, i.e. the uri of the person you 
    would like to know when she is online, and how to contact.
    The uri is usually something like 'sip:moby@sea.com'.<p>
</div>
Examples for subscribe: watch the presence information of Uli, she has 
the sip-id sip:uli@t-sip.de<p>
<div class="item"><code>
  pua.pl -s -i=ron@provider.net -x=provider.net -w=sip:uli@t-sip.de<p>
</code></div>

The proxy server provider.net is responsible to forward the request to the
presence server, the one who knows something about sip:uli@t-sip.de.<p>

Sometimes you can only subscribe when you are registered. Then both
-r and -s can be combined:<p>
<div class="item"><code>
  pua.pl -r -s -i=ron@provider.net -x=provider.net -w=sip:uli@t-sip.de<p>
</code></div>

When the server sends some information about Uli's presence, pua.pl
prints it on the console. For cases where this is not sufficient, it is
possible to pass a command to pua.pl, which is then executed. See 
<code>--exec-notify</code> below.<p>
 
It is not possible to subscribe to more than one sip-id, i.e. pua.pl can 
be called only with one -w parameter. However you can invoke more than
one instance of pua.pl. It is important that the second instance uses
a diffrent port number because the first instance occupies the default
port 5060, i.e.<p>
<div class="item"><code>
  pua.pl -s -i=ron@provider.net -x=provider.net -w=sip:uli@t-sip.de -lp 5059<p>
</code></div>

runs it on local port 5059 (instead of 5060, which is the default).



<h3><a name="p">Publish</a></h3>

To publish a contact address, this are the options. pua.pl supports only
one tuple per publish operation<p>
<div class="item">
  <code>--publish (-p)</code> to enable publishing<p>
  
  <code>--contact=uri (-c=uri)</code>: The contact address to be published. It
    can be any kind of address, like email or a telephone number. The uri 
    should include the scheme, e.g. <code>--contact tel:+09012345678</code>, or 
    <code>--contact mailto:someone@example.com</code> are valid.<p>

  <code>--status=stat</code> It is the basic status of your contact id (resp.
    sip id, in case <code>--contact</code> is not used), as it is transmitted 
    to the server, and published to other users. Expected values 
    for stat are: 'open' means you are open for communication 
    (this is the default), 'closed' means you don't want to be 
    contacted, or you are offline on this address. Other values
    are possibly not supported by the server.<p>

  <code>--note=text</code> It specifies some arbitrary text that will be 
    transmitted to the server, and published to other users. 
    E.g. "I'm in Tokio next week."

Example for publish, to tell the presence server that the person with the
sip-id ron@iptel.org is open for contact on the address 
ron@p5499A632.dip.t-dialin.net for instant messaging:<p>
<div class="item"><code>
  pua.pl -p --my-id=sip:ron@iptel.org -x=iptel.org --status=open --contact im:ron@p5499A632.dip.t-dialin.net<p>
</code></div>


<h3><a name="o">Advanced options</a></h3>

<div class="item">
  <code>-se, --subscribe-exp=duration</code> To be used in combination with <code>-s</code>
    (subscribe). Specifies the duration in seconds after 
    subscription should be refreshed, the shorter it is, the more 
    traffic is generated. Default value is 3600.<p>

  <code>-pe, --publish-exp=duration</code> To be used in combination with <code>-p</code>
    (publish). Specifies the duration in seconds how long a 
    published presence is valid. It controls how often the presence 
    status will be refshed. The shorter it is, the more traffic is 
    generated. Default value is 3600.<p>

  <code>-re, --register-exp=duration</code> To be used in combination with <code>-r</code>
    (register). Specifies the duration in seconds how long a 
    registration presence is valid, also it controls how often it 
    will be refshed. The shorter it is, the more traffic is 
    generated. Default value is 3600.<p>

  <code>--my-host=name</code> Hostname of this machine, as used in Via: headers
    and Contact headers, usually this is automatically detected. 
    But in some cases it makes sense to overwrite it, for instance
    when the machine is in a local network. <p>

  <code>-lp, --local-port=number</code> Port number where to wait for SIP 
    messages on this local machine, default is 5060.<p>

  <code>-rp, --remote-port=number</code> Port number of the SIP proxy, i.e. where 
    to send SIP messages on the remote machine. Default is 5060.<p>

  <code>-en, --exec-notify=cmd</code> Run cmd each time a notification of
    somebody's else presence status is received. Works only in 
    combination with <code>-s</code> (subscribe). The command gets a descriptive
    description of the status on stdin. Example: <code>-en 'cat &gt; /tmp/pres'</code>
    will re-write the file /tmp/pres each time the server sends a
    notification about the watched presentity. The file /tmp/pres
    then contains a text like 'xyz open for communication'. See the
    other <code>--exec</code> optiions for less descriptive methods. Please note:
    depending on the server settings and on <code>-re</code>, cmd might be 
    executed quite often.<p>

  <code>-eo, --exec-open=cmd</code> Run cmd each time a basic presence status 
    changes to open. The command cmd is invoked with a number of 
    switches on its own: <code>-e</code> entity name (usually a address in form
    sip:me@somwhere.net), <code>-s</code> status, here 'open', <code>-c contact address, 
    -p priority, -t timestamp</code>. A switch may be omitted, in case the 
    information is not available. Additionally, cmd may get on its 
    stdin an multi-line note. Cmd is invoked for each tuple, i.e. 
    it might be called more than once for one entity.<p>

  <code>-ec, --exec-closed=cmd</code> As <code>-eo</code>, but here the status has to change
    from open to closed (or from open to not available).<p>

  <code>-ro, --register-once</code> Register only once and then exit (assuming
    no <code>-s/-p given</code>). This is expected in combination with <code>-r</code>. If
    not set, the program will continue to run, and refresh the
    registration each time before it expires - this is the default.<p>

  <code>-po, --publish-once</code> Publish the presence only once and then 
    exit (assuming no <code>-r/-s given</code>), i.e. not refresh after expiry. <p>

  <code>-no, --notify-once</code> Leave the program after the first notification
    is received (assuming no <code>-p/-r</code> given). This is expected in 
    combination with <code>-s</code>. If not set, the program will continue to run, 
    and refresh the subscription each time before it expires.<p>
    
  <code>--login=name</code> local login name, as used in the Contact: header 
    field. On default the software will try to guess.<p>

  <code>-d, --debug=n</code> Set the debug level, values of n: 0 (quiet) up to
    5 (very noisy)<p>
</div>

<h3><a name="e">More on --exec</a></h3>

  For example, the program 'myprog' shall call everytime the presence 
  changes to open, then pua.pl is called with switch <code>--exec-open 'myprog'</code>. 
  Now, if the watched person (having for instance the sip address 
  sip:joseph@sipserv.de) goes online using the contact address 
  im:jo@jupm.org with the prio 0.5, the command 'myprog' will be called 
  like this:<p>
  
<div class="item"><code>
    myprog -e sip:joseph@sipserv.de -s open -c im:jo@jupm.org -p 0.5<p>
</code></div>

  The arguments for cmd are always in the same order, but only the first 2 are 
  always present (<code>-e, -s</code>). The watched person can specify more than one contact
  address, he/she uses. For instance, Jo also has given an email address 
  mailto:jo@yahoo.com, and Jo actually preferes to be contacted by email, as
  he is busy with a meeting. So he sets the priority of the email to 1, and 
  additionally gives a note "Preferably after 8 o'clock" to his im: address.
  With this setup, pua.pl will call myprog twice, as follows:<p>
  
<div class="item"><code>
    myprog -e sip:joseph@sipserv.de -s open -c mailto:jo@yahoo.com -p 1<br>
    myprog -e sip:joseph@sipserv.de -s open -c im:jo@jupm.org -p 0.5<p>
</code></div>
 
  The second call to myprog gets the text "Preferably after 8 o'clock" piped on 
  stdin. The arguments to myprog are simply appended, so if you wish to use
  redirection like <code>--exec-open 'echo &gt; /tmp/t1'</code>, it will not work as expected.
  Instead, it will call <code>"echo &gt; /tmp/t1 -e sip:joseph@sipserv.de..."</code><p>

  The last argument <code>-t timestamp</code> usually gives the time when the presence 
  information was created, it should be coded using IMPP datetime format 
  [RFC3339], a valid value would be 2005-06-21T16:49:29Z.<p>

  Unlike the other <code>--exec</code> options, pua.pl called with <code>--exec-notify=cmd</code>
  will cause cmd called everytime a notification is received. For example, running
  the program like this<p>
  
<div class="item"><code>
    pua.pl -en 'xmessage -file -' -s -watch sip:betty@srv.net ...<p>
</code></div>

  will invoke xmessage on each notificaton, i.e. it shows a X window with
  a string indicating the status of Betty.<p>

Get a tarball of the latest release from <a href="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/pua-pl">here</a>.<p>

pua.pl is tested with linux, perl v5.8.0 (which is pretty old). I think
it could run with windows/cygwin, but I didn't try. <p>

It requires perl, libwww (LWP), URI XML::Parser (which requires the 
<a href="http://www.libexpat.org/">Expat library</a>) and POE, see 
<a href="http://poe.perl.org">poe.perl.org</a>. The quick way to install 
both:<p>
  
<div class="item"><code>
  % perl -MCPAN -e shell<br>
  cpan&gt; install XML::Parser <br>
  cpan&gt; install POE <p>
</code></div>
  
pua.pl and the scripts for the web gateway may be copied only under terms 
of the GNU General Public License, see 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>.<p>

Running pua.pl behind a firewall is not possible, unless the firewall
is configured that it forwards all SIP traffic to the local machine. 
Usually that means port 5060 on the firewall has to be opened. When
pua.pl is used on a machine which is not directly connected to the 
internet, instead it is on a subnet with a IP only valid within the subnet,
and there is NAT (network address translation) performed, then there this is 
a problem - unless the gateway supports SIP, but this is not very likey.
I worked around this problem by using switch <code>--my-host=&lt;dns_name_of_my_router&gt;</code>
but this is not a approach that works in general.<p>

This software comes with absolutely no warranty, see again
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>. 
By using a powerful interpreter like perl, there is some risk that this software 
can be missused to interpret some malicious piece of code being received in a SIP message.
This is a severe problem, I've tried my best to avoid this, but there is 
still a risk. If you are in an environment where you can't accept the risk, 
better don't use it.<p>
