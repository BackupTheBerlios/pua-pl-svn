A simple command-line presence user agent. Partly conforms to RFC 3261 (SIP), 
3903 (PUBLISH), 3265 & 3856 (NOTIFY, SUBSCRIBE), 3863 (pidf).

Able to subscribe to other's presence, receive notifications and print
them, publish your own presence and register.

Common options:

  -r, --register: Send a REGISTER message to the registrar 
    server (specified with --registrar), so the system knows
    which ID and which machine you are using. This causes the
    server to remember a binding between your SIP identity uri 
    (see --my-sip-id) and the local machine. On termination of
    this programm, it removes the binding.

  -p, --publish: Send a PUBLISH message to the server, in order
    to make your own presence status known to other users.

  -s, --subscribe: Send a SUBSCRIBE message, to watch the 
    presence of somebody else (specified with --watch-id), and 
    to get notified when it changes.

  -v, --version: print version number and exit.

  -h, --help: What you see.

  --my-sip-id=uri: sets your SIP identity, usualy a URI of the form
    'sip:myname@domain.org'. 

  --my-name=name: Sets your real name to what will be shown to  
    other users. Optional parameter.

  -u, --username=name: Username for authentification at the remote
    server

  -pw, --password=xxxx: Password for authentification at the remote
    server, in combination with -u

  -x, --proxy=server: for the server name of the SIP proxy server,
    e.g. -x=iptel.org

  --options: List more exotic options


Publish options, use in combination with -p:

  -c, --contact=uri: The contact address to be published. Can be any 
    address, like email or telephone number. The addres should 
    include the scheme, e.g. --contact tel:+09012345678, or 
    --contact mailto:someone@example.com are valid.

  --status=stat: It is the basic status of your contact id (resp.
    sip id, in case --contact is not used), as it is transmitted 
    to the server, and published to other users. Expected values 
    for stat are: 'open' means you are open for communication 
    (this is the default), 'closed' means you don't want to be 
    contacted , or you are offline on this address. Other values
    are possibly not supported by the server.

  --note=text: It specifies some arbitrary text that will be 
    transmitted to the server, and published to other users. 
    E.g. "I'm in Tokio next week."


Subscribe options, use in combination with -s:

  -w, --watch-id=uri: It sets the uri of the person whose presence
    status is to be subscribed, i.e. the uri of the person you 
    would like to know when she is online, and how to contact.
    The uri is usually something like 'sip:moby@sea.com'.


Register options, in combination with -r:

  -rs, --registrar=uri: Name of the registrar server, an uri like
    'sip:someprovider.net:5060'. If no registrar is specified, 
    the register request will be sent to a server name constructed 
    from your address (as specified with --my-sip-id). E.g. for a 
    given address --my-sip-id=sip:myname@domain.org, the registrar 
    will be guessed as 'sip:domain.org'.

Continuation of options for pua.pl

  -se, --subscribe-exp=duration: To be used in combination with -s
    (subscribe). Specifies the duration in seconds after 
    subscription should be refreshed, the shorter it is, the more 
    traffic is generated. Default value is 3600.

  -pe, --publish-exp=duration: To be used in combination with -p
    (publish). Specifies the duration in seconds how long a 
    published presence is valid. It controls how often the presence 
    status will be refshed. The shorter it is, the more traffic is 
    generated. Default value is 3600.

  -re, --register-exp=duration: To be used in combination with -r
    (register). Specifies the duration in seconds how long a 
    registration presence is valid, also it controls how often it 
    will be refshed. The shorter it is, the more traffic is 
    generated. Default value is 3600.

  --my-host=name: Hostname of this machine, as used in e.g. Via: 
    headers, usually this is automatically detected. 

  --priority=nnn. Can be used in combination with -p and -c. It
    sets the priority of the contact possibilty as it is published
    with -c. A value of nnn of 1.0 means, this is your most prefered 
    way to contact you.

  -lp, --local-port=number: Port number where to wait for SIP 
    messages on this local machine, default is 5060

  -rp, --remote-port=number: Port number of the SIP proxy, i.e. where 
    to send SIP messages on the remote machine. Default is 5060

  -en, --exec-notify=cmd: Run cmd each time a notification of
    somebody's else presence status is received. Works only in 
    combination with -s (subscribe). The command gets a descriptive
    description of the status on stdin. Example: -en 'cat > /tmp/pres'
    will re-write the file /tmp/pres each time the server sends a
    notification about the watched presentity. The file /tmp/pres
    then contains a text like 'xyz open for communication'. See the
    other --exec optiions for less descriptive methods. Please note:
    depending on the server settings and on -re, cmd might be 
    executed quite often.

  -eo, --exec-open=cmd: Run cmd each time a basic presence status 
    changes to open. The command cmd is invoked with a number of 
    switches on its own: -e entity name (usually a address in form
    sip:me@somwhere.net), -s status, here 'open', -c contact address, 
    -p priority, -t timestamp. A switch may be omitted, in case the 
    information is not available. Additionally, cmd may get on its 
    stdin an multi-line note. Cmd is invoked for each tuple, i.e. 
    it might be called more than once for one entity.

  -ec, --exec-closed=cmd: As -eo, but here the status has to change
    from open to closed (or from open to not available).

  -ro, --register-once: Register only once and then exit (assuming
    no -s/-p given). This is expected in combination with -r. If
    not set, the program will continue to run, and refresh the
    registration each time before it expires - this is the default.

  -po, --publish-once: Publish the presence only once and then 
    exit (assuming no -r/-s given), i.e. not refresh after expiry. 

  -no, --notify-once: Leave the program after the first notification
    is received (assuming no -p/-r given). This is expected in 
    combination with -s. If not set, the program will continue to run, 
    and refresh the subscription each time before it expires.
    
  --login=name: local login name, as used in the Contact: header 
    field. On default the software will try to guess.

  -d, --debug=n: Set the debug level, values of n: 0 (quiet) up to
    5 (very noisy)

Note: sips protocol scheme is not supported.
